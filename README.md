# 🃏 Blackjack Game

A simple **Blackjack game** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Draw cards and try to hit 21 — but be careful not to go over!  
This was one of my early practice projects to improve my vanilla JS and DOM manipulation skills.

## ✨ Features
- 🂡 Draw random cards between 1–11.
- 🂢 Keep track of your total sum.
- 🎰 Win on exactly 21 — or bust if you go over.
- 🎮 Interactive UI that updates in real time.
- 💰 Display player name and chips balance.

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hayk-1315/Blackjack.git
cd blackjack

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
npm install

3️⃣ Run the game locally:
npm run dev
👉 This will open a local server — usually at http://localhost:5173/ — where you can play.

(Or you can simply open index.html directly in your browser if you don't want to use Vite!)

Click NEW CARD to draw another one.

Stop at any time or aim for 21 — just don’t go over!
